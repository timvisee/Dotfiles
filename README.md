# Tim does dotfiles
dotfiles are used to personalize your system and applications. These are mine.

## Installation
An installation script is included to easily install the dotfiles on your system.

On Linux, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/timvisee/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
sudo chmod a+x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

On Windows, the `install.bat` script may be used.
This only installs part of the dotfiles,
as most aren't supportd on this operating system.
